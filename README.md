1. You may see a warning of the form:  
  
"UserWarning: WARNING: valid_range not used since it cannot be safely cast to variable data type"  
  
This is not a fatal warning. when python pulls data from the netCDF file during  
the enumerate() function, the .valid_range attribute, used for data mask,  is not understood  
and therefore is not applied.   Since the time information in the enumerate()  
should not be masked to begin with, this *shouldn't* be a concern.  
  
2. FRSEAICE (sea ice-fraction) is the output 'ice fraction' variable, defined in the  
FLX file around Lines 235-241 of merra24clavrx.py. This is done because in comparison to GFS .hdf  
files, it appears the 'ice fraction' variable from GFS is only sea-ice fraction. In addition, the  
MERRA2 ice-fraction variable (FRACI) appears to be broken with fill-values over the ocean, the  
entirety of Antarctica, and most of Greenland. This variable is being collected and passed along to  
.hdf output as 'FRACI' for later fix/use.  
  
3. Input files are retrieved within the python code using [scripts/wget_all.sh](scripts/wget_all.sh)
Please see 
*[ How to Download Data Files from HTTPS Service with wget ]*(https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/howto?keywords=Wget&title=How%20to%20Download%20Data%20Files%20from%20HTTPS%20Service%20with%20wget)

The script calls nine wget scripts but some of the nine files are not 
currently being used by /clavrx-merra2/merra2/merra24clavrx.py to produce an output file. The  
current formulation does not make use of the inst6_3d_ana_Nv file, which contains analysis data on  
hybrid sigma-pressure coordinate surfaces. This file was intended to provide the data requested at  
the 0.9950 sigma-level, or a level close to it, but it looks like the 10m data is being substituted  
and it's working fine.  
  
4. Currently running the program for one year/month/day at a time using  [merra24clavrx.py](merra24clavrx.py)
The code needs the appropriate conda environment from [merra2_clavrx.yml ](merra2_clavrx.yml)

```
conda create -f merra2_clavrx.yml 
    conda activate merra2_clavrx
```
  
  
After running the run-script for a selected INPUT_DATE, files will appear in /tmp/out/YYYY/. This  
directory is currently being removed every time the run-script is used, so if you iterate over  
multiple dates, you'll scrub the output on every intermediate date and only have the output for the  
last date. You can get rid of this by commenting-out Lines 24-27 of test_merra24clavrx.sh.


JMF NOTES:
Use test_merra24_brett.sh to test original code.
